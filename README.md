# mli-application

Deep Learning Project for ML Institute application.

Important files are model.py and stream.py.
my model training and creation can be found in the main jupyter notebook

Live link to the deployed project can be found here: https://mli-application.onrender.com/

There are improvements that can be made to improve the quality of this project, such as retraining the model, augmenting the dataset, adding dropout layers, however my focus was on creating a functional application and deploying as fast as possible.
